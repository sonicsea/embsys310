1. When passing 5 arguments to func1, the 5th argument value is stored temporarily in R0, then the value will be stored on the stack. After that, the first 4 arguments are stored into R0, R1, R2 and R3. Therefore, func1 can use the value of the 4 first arguments directly from R0, R1, R2 and R3. The 5th argument value is on top of the stack for func1 to use.
2. Compiler generates code to push R7 and LR to the stack. R7 will store the value of the extra argument.
3. Push R4 to stack. Load value of the extra argument from the second top item (#0x4) of stack into R4. 
4. R4 gets popped out of the stack after the final result gets store in R0 in func1. Top element of the stack can be referenced as "[SP]", other elements can be referenced as "[SP, #0xINDEX]", where "INDEX" is multiple of 4. Registers,other than R0, R1, R2, R3, must be pushed to the stack for a function to use them.
